               it was not possible for us to dock anywhere in the orbit of Earth. Our only way is was to land the entire ship on the surface and then continue the journey ahead on the planet.
            </p>
            <p>After 240 years, a human would set foot on the planet, which they once called home.</p>
            <p>
               Planet wide scans clearly show that 90 percent of the planet is now under water. Humans were too fragile to go up against the pure wraith of mother Earth. We had abused her for 
               far too long, and it was all she could take.
            </p>
            <p>
                <i>"Thrusters at 10 percent, all hands prepare for atmospheric entry"</i>
                <br>
                <p>
                I commanded over the microphone as the ship threaded further into Earth's atmosphere.
                With a crew of five, we were the last hope to ensure the survival of humanity. The mission was deemed suicidal from the very beginning, but this wasn't a choice anyway. It was a 
                necessary sacrifice which simply couldn't be let go into vain. 
                </p>    
            </p>
            <p>
                I could see the fear in the eyes of my men, but I could feel t he determination in the ambience, which echoed on the bridge. My eyes danced back and forth between the instrument 
                cluster and out through the glass shield. I could see the blue planet, glistering between colours on the screen as numbers hovered calculating multiple parameters and checks. 
                I had my eyes locked at the surreal beauty of the planet. 
            </p>
            <p>
                It was as if all the legends and fairy tales were coming true, steadily as the ship needled the atmosphere of the planet. 
                Back on Mars, there were only photos, videos, stories and memories of this planet and ever since my childhood, I found it almost impossible to fathom that a place, filled with flora 
                and so many beautiful life forms could exist. Not in harmony, but at a balance. But now, Earth was as hostile as beautiful.          
            </p>
            <p>
                <i>"Entering atmosphere in 30, buckle up"</i>
                <p>
                Sarthak announced as he juggled between screens, carefully studying them and and writing numbers and points in his notebook.
                </p>
                <p>
                I was seated with Sarthak buckled at his place beside the helm. He turned & looked at me for a brief moment and turned back around to the console. Staring at the numbers and 
                overwhelming information again. I could tell he was nervous but had no intentions to make a verbal note of that. We all were nervous, scared and knew that thinking about 
                it won't do anything.
                </p>    
            </p>
            <p>
                As the ship dived further down into the atmosphere. I could feel the temperatures rising at the bridge. The ship, <i>"Forward Unto Dawn"</i>, was nose down at entry and was
                supposed to slowly generate life to bring the nose back up and glide to the designated landing area.    
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                The numbers on the screens when up and down as the Ocean beneath us grew larger; sunlight gleamed off the water surface and was bright enough to stress our eyes.  
            </p>
            <p>
                Forward Unto Dawn was a deep space liner. One of its kind. Stretching 480m in length & a deck spanning 180m across the breath. It's sole purpose was to take Humanity out 
                into deep, interstellar space. But everything changed in 2109. 
            </p>
            <p>
                The polar cap had already melted beyond repair. Most coastal regions were now submerged under water, becoming relics of time. Masses were relocated on Earth and to Lunar 
                & Martian colonies. The situation was under constant surveillance if not control. 
            </p>
            <p>
                I guess it was the month of June. Summer heat was raging down on Humanity during vacations. Though there was despair, the future looked promising and good. 
                Until midnight of 12th June.
            </p>
            <p>
                The entirety of the Europe was wiped out in a blink, by what was described to the rest of the world as an "explosion".
                The explosion was nuclear,  but it wasn't of human origin either.
            </p>
            <p>
                The explosion set shockwaves that caused earthquakes in Asia & in the west. The tremors were record as high as 9.1 on the Richter scale. Tsunamis brought turmoil to cities 
                as water further flooded into cities which were struck by series' of quakes. It was as extinction level event as writers and conspiracy theorists vented. The society lost 
                a third of its population in one night. But the losses were far greater than what the surviving humans investigated. World's best research facilities, hospitals, world
                leaders, scientists, great young minds & major military resources were all wiped out.            
            </p>
            <p>
                The origin or cause of the explosion was never known. To be honest, with loss of so many resources and ground zero being so hostile, I don't think anyone in their right 
                minds would focus the capital in research what went wrong and why instead of saving whatever was left of the human population. 
            </p>
            <p>
                It was never meant to sound poetic or mesmerizing in way. But countless books were written in the years that followed. Books written by Survivors and people who witnessed
                events first hand. Over the years, this event was superficially, and unanimous was named "Ocean Fall". If some poet wrote a prose or a poem titled something as such, my heart 
                says it'll probably be something romantic and surreal. But painting red flowers with blood won't make the painting beautiful, or will it?    
            </p>
            <p>
                Countless countries lost control over their nuclear reactor and facilities. The Blue planet was  now bleeding radiation from cuts made by reactor explosions. Cuts that 
                wouldn't heal for thousands of years. Cities were turned to ashes; graveyard. 
            </p>
            <p>
                There were riots, murders, rapes of men and women alike, theft of valuables, and theft of sanity; as the governments fell one after another. I could never witness all this, 
                with my own eyes and to be honest, part of me feels fortunate that I didn't. I always question myself, what does a human mind, or maybe, what does this human heart seek? 
                <p>
                    What's our purpose? <br>
                    No matter how I think and with what perspective, I come down to just one conclusion. <br>
                    We all seek happiness. At the end of the day, we all want to be happy and be able to sleep peacefully. <br>
                </p>
                <p>
                    To think of this way, you can really find the answer to why someone did what is rather deemed as wrong. <br>
                    People do things that make them happy. Good deeds, heroic actions, sacrifices. <br>
                </p>
                <p>
                    And Crimes.
                </p>  
            </p>
            <p>
                Humanity as a civilization had fallen. <br>
                Four years later, surviving leaders and people decided to abandon Earth with as many as people they can. People were hand-cuffed and forced to board the <i>Forward Unto Dawn</i>, 
                which was the only surviving vessel that could help humans abandon their homes. The ship was then docked at Mumbai Port, India. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Earth was abandoned, leaving with 11 thousand humans of Earth origin, out into the darkness to settle them in space colonies. 
                A number of smaller ferry ships and cruise ships made round trips to get as many people off Earth as they could. If we are to believe the records, they managed to evacuate around 
                43 thousand people in total. <br>
                I don't believe the records.
            </p>
            <p>
                These people along with the small colonies humanity had established in the space were bound to suffer. Discrimination, racism, scarcity of food, diseases & differences. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Rumour and inside information has it that that Martian and Lunar origin humans made a cult t o  eliminate the refugees as they have brought problems and turmoil to them.
            </p>
            <p>
                It was advocated that Earth bound problems are not their concern and hence, differences only grew wider with time. Little did the na√Øve humans of the past knew they're equally 
                part of the problem. 
            </p> <br>
            <p>
                Two generations later; after countless conflicts between communities, countless stories and new discoveries. The differences started to settle in as the newer generations realized 
                that the problems could only be solved if all act together. Soon enough, humanity saw birth of a child born to a Martian father and an Earth bound Mother. Colonies slowly expanded in
                region, new jobs were made. New sections of society were made, making sure not to repeat the mistakes humans made back on Earth.
            </p>
            <p>
                Earth was stranded and never looked back to. All life form suffered but only a portion of humanity could survive in physical form. Spiritually, and psychologically, humanity was 
                revived. People who could make it through the adversity, carried the little memories, stories, cultures and beliefs of the what was once a bigger picture.   
            </p>

                <i>And Survived the three Vaults.</i> 
            </p>
            <p>
                The Seed Vault, The Arctic Code Vault and the Darwin Gene Vault.
            </p>
            <p>
                Humanity was prepared for extinction before they even started preparing for life beyond Earth. <br>
                The three vaults were constructed in the most isolated regions of the planet in the 21st century, and were improved over the years that followed. 
            </p>
            <p>
                The Seed Vault had seeds of every possible plant of Earth, the Arctic Code Vault had the most important and crucial Computer programs ever written by Humans and the Darwin Gene Vault
                had the genomes of every specie of Earth, except Humanity. These Vaults were constructed to help humanity rebuild society in case of calamity.  
            </p>
            <p>
                Our mission was simple. We, five humans of Earth origin were tasked to retrieve everything off these Vaults to help sustain and build the future Human society.
