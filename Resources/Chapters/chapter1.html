               it was not possible for us to dock anywhere in the orbit of Earth. Our only way is was to land the entire ship on the surface and then continue the jouney ahead on the planet.

            <p>After 240 years, a human would set foot on the planet, which they once called home.</p>
            <p>
               Planet wide scans clearly show that 90 percent of the planet is now under water. Humans were too fragile to go up against the pure wraith of mother Earth. We had abused her for 
               far too long, and it was all she could take.

                I commanded over the microphone as the ship threaded further into Earth's atmosphere.
                With a crew of five, we were the last hope to ensure the survival of humanity. The mission was deemed suicidal from the very beginning, but this wasn't a choice anyway. It was a 
                necessary sacrifice which simply couldn't be let go into vain.

                I could see the fear in the eyes of my men, but I could feel t he determination in the ambience, ehich echoed on the bridge. My eyes danced back and forth between the instrument 
                cluster and out through the glass shield. I could see the blue planet, glistering between colors on the screen as numbers hovered calculating multiple parameters and checks. 
                I had my eyes locked at the surreal beauty of the planet. 
            </p>
            <p>
                It was as if all the legends and fairy tales were coming true, steadily as the ship needled the atmosphere of the planet. 
                Back on Mars, there were only photos, videos, stories and memories of this planet and ever since my childhood, I found it almost impossible to fathom that a palce, filled with flora 
                and so many beautiful life forms could exist. Not in hormony, but at a balance. But now, Earth was as hostile as beautiful.

                Sarthak announced as he juggled between screens, carefully studying them and and writing numbers and points in his notebook.
                </p>
                <p>
                I was seated with Sarthak buckled at his place beside the helm. He turned & looked at me for a brief moment and turned back around to the console. Staring at the numbers and 
                overwhelming information again. I could tell he was nervous but had no intentions to make a verbal note of that. We all were nervous, scared and knew that thinking about 
                it won't do anything.

                As the ship dived further down into the atmosphere. I could feel the temperatures rising at the bridge. The ship, <i>"Forward Unto Dawn"</i>, was nose down at entry and was
                supposed to slowly generate life to bring the nose back up and glide to the designated landing area.    
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                The numbers on the screens when up and down as the Ocean beneath us grew larger; sunlight gleamed off the water surface and was bright enough to stress our eyes.
